  Problem 1
    - laravel/ui[v3.2.0, ..., 3.x-dev] require illuminate/console ^8.0 -> found illuminate/console[v8.0.0, ..., 8.x-dev] but these were not loaded, likely because it conflicts with another require.
    - Root composer.json requires laravel/ui ^3.2 -> satisfiable by laravel/ui[v3.2.0, v3.2.1, 3.x-dev].
